# proxy_watchdog
Watch a proxy, and do something if needed.

## How to config
Edit the script directly. Help info about configs is in the script too.

## How to use
First, you need Python 3, not 2.  
Use "nohup" or run it as a service.  
An example of using "nohup":
``` bash
    nohup python3 -u proxy_watchdog.py > proxy_watchdog.out &
```
